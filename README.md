# Live-Subtitles
Discord bot
# About
The discord live subtitles bot is a bot that can accurately read messages (and listen in future release) and translate them to any supported language desired. It is able to translate messages and report back the translation in text or also say the translation in a voice channel as well. Use the /help command to figure out how to use the bot specifically.
# Additional information
This bot uses the Pycord API. Previously the Discord.py API was used but due to its lack of voice capabilities (recieving audio), the switch to Pycord was necessary for the future release of listening to the user speak for a translation. For the translation aspect, the Google Translator API found on rapidAPI was used (https://rapidapi.com/IRCTCAPI/api/google-translator9)
